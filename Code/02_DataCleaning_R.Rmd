Part 1: Cleaning the Data I scraped from Wikipedia

In the R script below, I take the csv file that I scraped from Wikipedia's historical list of seiges, clean it, and add several columns of data, producing several different data sets, which I have saved in the 'Data' folder as csv files. 

```{r}
#Setting my working directory
setwd(dir= "/Users/MelissaCarlson/Desktop/PS239T-Final-Project/Data")

#Remove all existing objects in my environment
rm(list=ls())

#Loading the required libraries for data cleaning
library(foreign)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#Importing the data I scraped from Wikipedia
scraped_siege_list <- read.csv(file= "1-ListofSiegesScrapedfromWikipedia.csv", stringsAsFactors=F, header = FALSE)

#Changing the names of the header of the dataset
names(scraped_siege_list) <- c("SiegeName", "Year", "Location")

#Splitting the SeigeName column, which currently has all data, 
#into two columns, "Name" of the siege and "Year"
scraped_siege_list <- separate(scraped_siege_list, SiegeName, c("Name", "Year"), sep = "[(]")

#Splitting the Year column, which currently has the years and 
#name of the war, into two columns, "Year" and "WarName"
scraped_siege_list <- separate(scraped_siege_list, Year, c("Year", "WarName"), sep = "[)-]")

#Getting rid of extra, blank rows
SiegeList_Cleaned <- scraped_siege_list[1:3]

#I now export the dataframe as a csv. There are several errors I need to fix manually, 
#and several sieges I need to add that were not on the Wikipedia list. I also added 
#another column of data about siege characteristics
write.csv(SiegeList_Cleaned, file = "2-SiegeList-Cleaned.csv")

#Reloading the final data set back into R
ModernSiegeList <- read.csv(file="3-SiegeList-Cleaned-additions.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

#Since I want to visualize the number of sieges per war, I use the spread 
#and gather functions from the dplyer package to create seperate dataframe 
#(I do so by counting the number that a given war shows up in WarName)
siegesperwar.df <- count(ModernSiegeList, WarName)

#I export this particular data frame to add another data column from outside 
#data and reload it back into R
write.csv(siegesperwar.df, file = "4-SiegeperWar.csv")
siegeperwar <- read.csv("5-SiegeperWar-additions.csv")

```
